              <strong>Restoring Roots:</strong> Community-Led Mangrove Conservation and Livelihoods in Sierra Leone
            </p>

            <p>
              Sierra Leone is home to approximately 105,300 hectares of mangrove forests in the Sherbro River Estuaryâ€”an ecosystem
              vital for biodiversity, coastal protection, and local livelihoods. However, increasing human activities and rapid
              population growth along the coast are accelerating the degradation of these crucial habitats.

              , is working actively in Bonthe District to combat this loss. Through community-based initiatives, SEED is promoting
              sustainable mangrove management while enhancing alternative livelihoods for local residents.
            </p>

            <p>
              Efforts include training communities on the ecological and economic benefits of mangrove conservation, as well as
              introducing sustainable practices such as vegetable farming and oyster harvesting. These interventions not only aim
              to protect the mangroves but also empower communities to thrive economically without harming their natural environment.
