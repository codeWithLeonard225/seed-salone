              <strong>Unlocking Potential:</strong> Empowering Rural Women Through Microloans and Enterprise Support:
            </p>

            <p>
              Many women in rural areas possess strong entrepreneurial potential and creativity, yet they are often
              relegated to unpaid farm labor due to limited access to land and other essential resources.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>SEED</strong> is committed to empowering these women by offering small loans that allow them
              to tap into their skills, establish micro-enterprises, and create their own sources of employment. In doing so,
              they can generate income and contribute to the rural economy, advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.
            </p>
